# Mandalorian

## Pre-requisites
### Python3
    sudo apt install python3
### Colorama Library
    pip3 install colorama

## Movement
 - W for activating jetpack
 - A for left
 - D for right
 - F to shoot gun
 - Space to activate shield
 - Q to quit

## Score and Lives
 - Score is displayed on the top equals to number of coins taken.

 - Both time and the lives of the Mandalorian are limited. So the ’time remaining’ and ’lives remaining’ is displayed on the top along with the score. Game when all lives are over, or if the user quits by pressing ’Q’, or if the time is over.

## Obstacles 

 - Fire Beams: Beam like structures appear as obstacles. There are three kinds of beams: horizontal, vertical and some at 45 with the ground/platform. 

 - Magnet: A magnet should randomly appear on the way, which will influence the motion of the
    Mandalorian. So if he is in the range of the magnet, he would be continuously attracted towards
    the magnet.

## Power-Ups 

 - Speed boost: The speed of the game will increase upon taking this power-up. 
 
 - Shield: A shield should appear around the Mandalorian using which, he will not be affected by the enemies and obstacles. The shield will be activated using the ’Space’ key and will last for 20 seconds. It will take 60 seconds for shield power-up to refill again after use.

## The Boss Enemy!! 

 - The boss enemy will have multiple lives, which will decrease when the Mandalorian shoots bullets at it. Once the boss enemy is defeated, Baby Yoda can be rescued and the game is complete.
